# Changelog

## 2026-05-18 — 1Password Exact Field Reads
- Updated `one-password` to avoid tmux window-index assumptions and document exact-label JSON extraction when `op --field` resolves an ambiguous concealed field.

## 2026-05-18 — 1Password Service Account Priority
- Updated `one-password` to prefer scoped service-account access before interactive desktop-app sign-in and to ask before fallback when scoped access is missing.

## 2026-05-18 — Browser Reattach Defaults
- Updated `browser-use` to call the default mcporter `chrome-devtools` reattach target without a temporary config file.
- Added browser-use mcporter config notes for diagnosing blank/isolated Chrome attachments and restoring the reattach config.

## 2026-05-18 — Lean Fix Guidance
- Added AGENTS guidance to prefer clean bounded refactors over tiny shims and avoid compat/edge-case scaffolding except for real public/API, upgrade, security, or production states.

## 2026-05-16 — Codex Review Gitcrawl Repair
- Extended `codex-review` Gitcrawl recovery guidance to inspect portable manifest, source/runtime DB health, and portable-store status before live fallback.
- Updated `codex-review` to run `gitcrawl doctor --json` for malformed local Gitcrawl DB errors before falling back to live GitHub reads.

## 2026-05-16 — GitHub Project Triage Scope
- Updated `github-project-triage` to default broad queue scans to `steipete` and `openclaw`, sort PR triage by PR count, and preserve RepoBar order when summarizing.

## 2026-05-14 — Video Transcript Dependency Update
- Updated `video-transcript-downloader` to `youtube-transcript-plus` 2.0.0.

## 2026-05-14 — Codex Review Finding Detection
- Updated `codex-review` to capture review output, report elapsed time, fail on reported P0-P3 findings, and treat empty review output as non-clean.

## 2026-05-14 — Codex Review Full Access
- Added `codex-review --full-access` for nested review runs that need localhost bind/listen tests without sandbox noise.

## 2026-05-14 — GitHub Search Shim Guidance
- Added AGENTS guidance to prefer shimmed `gh` / `gitcrawl gh` for broad reads and avoid raw Search API POST mistakes.

## 2026-05-14 — Codex Review Base Caveat
- Documented that `codex review --base` must not include an inline prompt; use a separate follow-up pass for custom instructions.
- Clarified that committed or PR branch review must use branch/base mode, not `--uncommitted` / local mode.

## 2026-05-14 — Codex Review Loop Guidance
- Clarified that `codex-review` should iterate until no accepted findings remain and document intentional rejections with useful inline comments when warranted.

## 2026-05-14 — README Skills Overview
- Rewrote the README around agent instructions, skills, helper scripts, and sync expectations; removed stale copied-origin notes.

## 2026-05-14 — Codex Review Skill
- Added a `codex-review` skill and helper for closeout reviews, with stdout-only default output and subagent filtering guidance for noisy review output.

## 2026-05-13 — Checkout Discipline
- Added CLI checkout/worktree guardrails: stay in repo cwd by default, never create worktrees unless asked, and treat sibling checkouts under `~/Projects` as user-managed.

## 2026-05-13 — Skill Metadata Guardrails
- Added generic skill-description guidance and quieter browser recovery notes to reduce noisy auth prompts and token-heavy skill metadata.

## 2026-05-11 — clawmac GUI Access Note
- Documented the Peekaboo through Jump Desktop workflow for clawmac GUI prompts and Chrome Safe Storage verification.
- Documented `crabmac` as Peter's typo/alias for `clawmac`.

## 2025-12-22 — Remove Custom rm Shim
- Dropped `bin/rm` and `scripts/trash.ts`; rely on the system `trash` command for recoverable deletes.

## 2025-12-17 — Remove Runner; Keep Guardrails
- Removed the `runner` wrapper and `scripts/runner.ts` now that modern Codex sessions handle long-running/background work directly.
- Kept the safety-critical bits as standalone shims: `bin/rm` (moves deletes to Trash via `scripts/trash.ts`).
- Dropped the `find -delete` interception and the `bin/sleep` shim.

## 2025-12-02 — Release Preflight Helpers
- Added shared release helpers in `release/sparkle_lib.sh`: clean working-tree check, Sparkle key probe, changelog finalization/notes extraction, and appcast monotonicity guard for version/build.
- Documented the helper functions in `docs/RELEASING-MAC.md` so Trimmy/CodexBar-style release scripts can reuse them.

## 2025-11-18 — Console Log Capture
- Added `console` command to `scripts/browser-tools.ts` for capturing and monitoring Chrome DevTools console output with real-time formatting, type filtering (log, error, warn, etc.), continuous follow mode, and configurable timeouts with automatic object serialization.

## 2025-11-22 — Search & Content Extraction
- Added `search` and `content` commands to `scripts/browser-tools.ts` for Google SERP scraping with optional readable markdown extraction and single-URL readability output, leveraging the existing DevTools-connected Chrome instance.
- `eval` now supports `--pretty-print` to inspect complex objects with indentation and colors.

## 2025-11-15 — Chrome Browser Tools
- Added `scripts/browser-tools.ts`, a DevTools-ready Chrome helper copied from the Oracle repo so agents can inspect, screenshot, and terminate sessions without dragging in the full CLI. The workflow is inspired by Mario Zechner’s [“What if you don’t need MCP?”](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/).
- Documented the new helper in the README so downstream repos know how to run `pnpm tsx scripts/browser-tools.ts --help`.

## 2025-11-16 — Browser Tools Pipe Detection
- Updated `scripts/browser-tools.ts` to enumerate and kill Chrome instances started with `--remote-debugging-pipe` (the default for Peekaboo/Tachikoma) in addition to the classic `--remote-debugging-port`. List/kill now show “debugging pipe” when no port exists and still fetch tab metadata when it does.
- README now notes the optional `NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g)` trick so the helper can run from bare copies of the repo without a local `package.json`.

## 2025-11-14 — Compact Runner Summaries
- The runner's completion log now defaults to a compact `exit <code> in <time>` format so long commands don't repeat the entire input line.
- Added the `RUNNER_SUMMARY_STYLE` env var with `compact` (default), `minimal`, and `verbose` options so agents can pick how much detail they want without editing the script.
- Timeout heuristics now understand both `pnpm` and `bun` invocations automatically, so long-running Bun scripts/tests get the same guardrails without repo-specific patches.
- `sleep` invocations longer than 30 seconds are clamped to the 30s ceiling instead of erroring, which keeps wait hacks working while still honoring the AGENTS.MD limit.

## 2025-11-08 — Sleep Guardrail & Git Shim Refresh
- Runner now rejects any `sleep` argument longer than 30 seconds, mirroring the AGENTS rule and preventing long blocking waits.
- Added `bin/sleep` so plain `sleep` calls automatically route through the runner and inherit the enforcement without extra flags.
- Simplified `bin/git` to delegate directly to the runner + system git, eliminating the bespoke policy checker while keeping consent gates identical.

## 2025-11-08 — Guardrail Sync & Docs Hardening
- Synced guardrail helpers with Sweetistics so downstream repos share the same runner, docs-list helper, and supporting scripts.
- Expanded README guidance around runner usage, portability, and multi-repo sync expectations.
- Added committer lock cleanup, tightened path ignores, and refreshed misc. helper utilities (e.g., `toArray`) to reduce drift across repos.

## 2025-11-08 — Initial Toolkit Import
- Established the repo with the Sweetistics guardrail toolkit (runner, git policy enforcement, docs-list helper, etc.).
- Ported documentation from the main product repo so other projects inherit the identical safety rails and onboarding notes.
